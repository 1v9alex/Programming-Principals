"""
Write a function which is given an exam mark, and it returns a string â€” the grade for that mark â€” according to this scheme:

Mark

Grade

>= 90

A

[80-90)

B

[70-80)

C

[60-70)

D

< 60

F

The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals. A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it. So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.

Test your function by printing the mark and the grade for a number of different marks.
