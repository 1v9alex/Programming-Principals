# Python Composition and Inheritance Practice

## Very Easy

1. **Basic Inheritance**:
   - Create a class `Vehicle` and a subclass `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle`.
   - Add an attribute `number_of_wheels` to `Vehicle` and override it in `Car`.

2. **Simple Composition**:
   - Define two classes, `Author` and `Book`.
   - A `Book` should contain an `Author` as its attribute.

3. **Animal Sounds**:
   - Extend the `Animal` class with different subclasses (like `Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`).
   - Give each a unique sound method.

4. **Colorful Shapes**:
   - Create a `Shape` class and extend it with different shapes (like `Circle`, `Square`).
   - Add a color attribute to the shapes.

5. **Basic Calculator**:
   - Implement a base class `Calculator` and subclasses like `AddCalculator`, `SubtractCalculator`.
   - Each subclass should perform a specific operation.

## Easy

1. **Employee System Extension**:
   - Extend your `Employee` class with specific types of employees like `Developer`, `Designer`.
   - Give them unique methods or attributes.

2. **Book Genres**:
   - Extend your `Book` class into different genres like `Fiction`, `NonFiction`.
   - Add genre-specific attributes.

3. **Educational Institution**:
   - Create a class `Person` and extend it with `Student` and `Teacher`.
   - Add attributes like `courses` for `Teacher` and `enrolled_courses` for `Student`.

4. **Simple Banking System**:
   - Create a `BankAccount` class and extend it with `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount`.
   - Add unique attributes like interest rate or transaction limit.

5. **Basic Geometric Shapes**:
   - Make a `Shape` class with methods for area and perimeter.
   - Extend it into shapes like `Rectangle` and `Triangle` with specific calculations.

## Medium

1. **Advanced Employee Management**:
   - Add more complexity to your employee classes with methods for promotions, raises, and detailed information display.

2. **Library Management System**:
   - Enhance your `Book` class to include borrowing, returning, and availability status functionalities.

3. **School Subjects and Classes**:
   - Extend your `Teacher` and `Student` classes to handle multiple subjects and classes.
   - Include methods for assigning and submitting assignments.

4. **Intermediate Banking System**:
   - Expand your banking system to handle different types of transactions, fraud detection, and account recovery options.

5. **Polygon Shape System**:
   - Create a more advanced shape system with multiple polygon classes like `Pentagon`, `Hexagon`.
   - Each class should have its methods for area and perimeter.

## Hard

1. **Complex Employee Hierarchy**:
   - Implement a complex hierarchy in your employee system with multiple levels of management and staff.
   - Include distinct roles and responsibilities for each.

2. **Advanced Library System**:
   - Develop an advanced library system with user accounts, book reservations, and late fees calculations.

3. **Comprehensive School Management System**:
   - Build a comprehensive system to manage an entire school, including schedules, grades, and extracurricular activities.

4. **Full-Fledged Banking Application**:
   - Create a complete banking application with account types, loans, interest calculations, and customer service features.

5. **Advanced Geometric Shape Calculator**:
   - Develop an advanced shape calculator capable of handling a wide variety of shapes.
   - Include calculations for irregular shapes.
